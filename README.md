-> Numerical Value Prediction Model using Deep Learning

This project showcases a deep learning-based numerical value prediction model, specifically designed to predict handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. 
The model preprocesses the input images by normalizing pixel values by dividing them by 255, effectively reducing the dimensionality and enhancing the training efficiency.
The deep learning architecture, comprising multiple layers, is trained and tested to ensure accurate digit recognition.
